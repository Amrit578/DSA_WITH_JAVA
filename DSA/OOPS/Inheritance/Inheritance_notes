Question 1) What is inheritance?
Answer) Inheritance in java child class acquire all the properties and behavior of parent class.

        You can inherit properties using extends keyword
        When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and field of parent class.

        You can add new method and field in your current class also.
        Child class means it have a properties of base class plus it have some additional properties its own.


        Example: -
        Box box1 = new BoxWeight();
        //when a reference to a subclass object is assign to a superclass reference variable you will only have to access only those parts
          of the object that are only define in superclass.

        BoxWeight box1 = new Box();

        // There are many variable in both parent class and child class.
        // You are given access to variable that are in the ref type i.e BoxWeight
        // Hence, you should access to weight variable.
        // This also means, that the ones you are trying to access should be initailised.
        // But here, when the object itself is of type parent class, how will you call the constructor of child class.

Question) Why we use Inheritance?
Answer) For method overriding ( so runtime polymorphism achieved).
        For code Reusability.
