** Internal Linked List work.

   1) Linked list act as a dynamic array and we do not specify the size while creating it The size of list automatically increase when we
      dynamically add and remove items.

   2) The Linked List is implemented using the doublt Linked List data structure.
      The main difference between a normal list and doubly linked list is that doubly Linked Lis contain extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer.
